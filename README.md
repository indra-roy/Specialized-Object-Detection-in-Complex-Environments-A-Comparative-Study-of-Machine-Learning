# Specialized-Object-Detection-in-Complex-Environments-A-Comparative-Study-of-Machine-Learning
Specialized Object detection is a more focused object detection system. We used it to detect damage to vehicles through image processing. Our project can correctly identify if a car is damaged or Not Damaged. We used a sequential neural network to train our model.
